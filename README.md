### Description
A LEGO Mindstorms EV3 robot coded using Matlab to autonomously navigate and assist wheelchair users. The car was equipped with ultrasonic distance sensors, touch sensors, and color sensors. These sensors were used to navigate the course autonomously.

### Contribution
"Journey Assist" was developed as part of a collaborative team project, where I took on the role of lead designer and developer. As the primary leader for the creation of the robot, I oversaw the entire design process, from conceptualization to execution, while also handling all aspects of coding and technical implementation.
