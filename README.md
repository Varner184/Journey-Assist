### Description
A LEGO Mindstorms EV3 robot coded using Matlab to autonomously navigate and assist wheelchair users. The car was equipped with ultrasonic distance sensors, touch sensors, and color sensors. These sensors were used to navigate the course autonomously. Over the course of the project, our team faced several issues including: motors operating at different speeds, missing parts, and sensor flaws. We were able to overcome these issues by modifying the code to mitigate these issues. For example, we had to slightly increase the speed our of right motor to ensure the robot drove straight and alter the rotation degrees to get the robot to turn as close to 90 degrees as possible.

### Contribution
"Journey Assist" was developed as part of a collaborative team project, where I took on the role of lead designer and developer. As the primary leader for the creation of the robot, I oversaw the entire design process, from conceptualization to execution, while also handling all aspects of coding and technical implementation.
